The MyTime Automator for Wipro™ MyTime uses the CasperJS framework to automate some of the repetitive tasks in filling the efforts in MyTime - so as to _save_ **your** time :innocent:.

## Usage
Open  the _wipromytimeinternal.js_ ~~or _wipromytimeexternal.js_~~(refer [Note](#note) below) file with your prefered text editor and enter your username and password in the appropriate areas inside the ~~appropriate~~ file. Then run the command:

` casperjs file_name.js `

with the appropriate filename in the command prompt. The script will automatically login with your credentials and open the MyTime app, then retrieve the attendance and update your efforts according to the specified values or it will default to entering the _Training section_ with your _Current Days attendance_.

##### Batch File Instructions
You could also use the Batch files (.bat) to execute the scripts by just double-clicking them, it would automatically open up command prompt and run the casperjs command, however the credentials will still have to be entered, though this only works on windows.

Make sure the .bat file and the appropriate .js file are in the same directory and that the correct .bat file is run in accordance with the correct .js file, i.e. internalBatch.bat -> wipromytimeinternal.js ~~and externalBatch.bat -> wipromytimeexternal.js~~, or just edit the batch file with the right path.

The ability to just double-click a file and have the time updated automatically truly makes the process even smoother in my opinion. Just double-click, sit back, relax and enjoy! :bowtie:

### Requirements 
![PhantomJS version](https://img.shields.io/badge/PhantomJS-2.1.1-green.svg?style=flat-square)
![CasperJS version](https://img.shields.io/badge/CasperJS-1.1.0-red.svg?style=flat-square)

* PhantomJS 2.1.1 - [Installaton instructions](http://phantomjs.org/download.html)
* CasperJS 1.1.0 - [Installaton instructions](http://docs.casperjs.org/en/latest/installation.html)
* Appropriate credentials (_obviously_ :stuck_out_tongue:)

### Note
The wipro external file (wipromytimeexternal.js) is no longer needed as gateway is no longer necessary and the wipromytimeinternal.js file is sufficient for both internal and external networks. However I've left the external file as it is, for anyone who wishes to use gateway as it hasn't been scrapped yet.
